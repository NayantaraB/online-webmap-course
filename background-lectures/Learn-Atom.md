# What is Atom?
Atom is an open-source code editor developed by the folks at Github. This means that it is well maintained by a huge global community and a major organization. [You can download it here](https://atom.io/). I like using it to code offline (or online) and push changes to my Github repositories once I'm back online. To do this you will also need Github desktop installed on your machine. [You can download Github Desktop here](https://desktop.github.com/).

Unlike other IDEs such as PyCharm or WebStorm, Atom is a text editor that allows you to use a variety of packages to customize it's functionality to give you an "IDE-like" capability. Atom is an extremely common code editor and I prefer using it because it's freely available, easy to configure, and easy to learn.

You can [learn the basics (and a lot more) of Atom here](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/) on the official site. This is a good place to get it set up and configured.

## Adding Packages
Packages are easy to install ([see instructions here](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)) and there are almost ten thousand packages you can use to customize Atom, depending on your needs: [see the full list here](https://atom.io/packages).

It's easy to find blog posts about what people think are the most important packages. Just trying searching "atom packages best" plus whatever your specialty is (e.g. web development, python, etc) and you'll find tons.

That being said, there are a few specific packages that I recommend you use for this class.

- [Autocomplete](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/autocomplete/): does what it says, it prompts you with different code completions and does things like automatically close parentheses, etc.
- [Atom Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server): allows you to create a "localhost" on your computer. This basically means that your computer acts like an Internet server so that you can test functionality of your files. In the old days, you could simply drag web files into a browser, but most browsers don't allow this anymore. Enabling a localhost allows you to set up and work on websites without any network connection. So you can work â€œoffline." Your pages won't be accessible via Internet unless you publish them, and can only be viewed by you.
- [HTML Preview](https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview): this is very similar to having a live server. In fact, I use this package the majority of the time I'm creating web maps to preview how they look, get a feel for functionality, etc.
- [Markdown Preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus): just like the HTML preview, this allows you to see how Github will render your `.md` files (like this one!). I use this a ton when creating documentation.
- [Beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify): is a package that helps clean up your code! It will do things like help clean up indents, line everything up right, etc. If Beautify isn't specific enough for you... [Linters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) are tools that help debug a variety of errors in code. Atom has a [large number of different linters for specific languages](https://atomlinter.github.io/) that you might want to explore. [This video shows an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9EEkSCbWM) of using a linter for a specific type of Javascript work.
- A few other fun ones that I find helpful but that aren't as critical as the ones above are [Highlight selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected), [Symbol list](https://atom.io/packages/symbols-list), [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) and [Color Picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker).

Happy coding!
